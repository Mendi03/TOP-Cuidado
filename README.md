# TOP-Cuidado
An mobile app that tracks and manages mental health for youths in Puerto Rico

### Overview
This project was created thanks to the awareness raised by the people of The Opportunity Project and advanced with the objective of Enhancing Childrenâ€™s Resilience in Puerto Rico. We chose to resolve this problem by Nurturing Positive Mental Reinforcement practices and attitudes in the youth of Puerto Rico. Our method of choice is our mobile application "Cuidado" with mental health support as its main objective while also being used for educational purposes.

### Background
Mental health statistics and outcomes among Puerto Rican youth is low and trending downward (as outlined by the Federal URS system and the 2021 American Community Survey) 

Some Possible Main causes of Mental Health Illness:

* Poverty: 76% of PR youth from 14 to 24 live in low-income families (2016 - 2020)

* Natural Disasters: Hurricanes occur about 2 times a year on average and mostly affect the West and East regions

* Distrust in Authorities: Some User advocates mentioned the concerns and mistrust PR people have with the Government
